# Calculation-of-PVy-program
This program is calculated the meridional potential vorticity gradient(PVy).

The program is designed to calculate the barotropic and baroclinic PVy. If you have any suggestions for improving the program, please feel free to contact us
(Email:shijq@tea.ac.cn; luobinhe@stu.ouc.edu.cn).

If you wish to learn more about PVy-related content, please refer to the following paper.
